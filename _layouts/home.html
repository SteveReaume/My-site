        <p class="white-copy">I'm not really spiderman. Or maybe I am and I'm just trying to throw you off. But I knew you would expect that since you love comic books and what not, so maybe this is nothing but a distraction from the truth that I am, in fact, spiderman. Or maybe it's an excuse for this to look like I wrote down more than it seems. Either way, I came to graphic design after graduating from the University of Windsor with a degree in biology. I've always enjoyed learning science, but not conducting experiments and researching four hours for a few references, so I opted for a creative direction after I was done. I was tentative to go into something with an artistic dimension, what with all the bad rep artistic careers are given, but now I realize it was the better choice. I watch my share of anime, but not many old ones - which I'm guessing has you sneering right now - and I love any kind of creative work with a good story. My mind is consistently blown by the works of certain concept artists, like Marc Simonetti, and even if my career doesn't end up in that field, I'd love to delve very deep into digital painting. Spidey seneses are tingling. Err, I mean, I have to go do stuff that is uneventful and not even remotely interesting to the common human... person.
